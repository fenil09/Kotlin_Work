What is the difference between IntArray and Array<Int>


-> This first one which is the IntArray is an primitive Integers array and there is no overhead for boxing which means that it does not require the extra memory
and performance cost when been used inside the code and in the case of Array<Int> these contains elements which are wrap around the primitive Integer which creates the overhead
as they are been boxed.

-> The issue with using the Array<Int> is that as they are boxed elements and accessing them and using these elements would require some extra memory which can eventually
affect the performance of the code.

-> IntArray would be consisting of primitive integers value where as when an array is declared using Array<Int> would be having the objects or values which are been wraped around an primitive value which results in some extra memory consumption
